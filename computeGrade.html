    You are given grade1 and grade2 which are 
    strings.Use them to compute the final grade. Final grade is grade1 (if it is 
    not empty), else it is grade2 (if it is not empty) 
     else it should be D. Use logical operator instead of if.
     <script>
        let grade1 = '';
        let grade2 = 'B';
        let finalGrade = grade1 || grade2 || 'D';
